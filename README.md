# GMR Changes to GeMS Tools for ArcGIS Pro <img width="300" align="right" src="https://www.virginia.gov/media/vagov/images/agencies/dmme_logo.jpg"/>

This repository contains scripts to extend the USGS ArcGIS toolbox of Python 3 geoprocessing tools for creating, manipulating, and validating [GeMS](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/)-style geologic map databases for use in ArcGIS Pro.

## Using the toolbox
New tools should be available in the "GMR" section of the toolbox. Updates to existing tools will appear in the same section as in the USGS toolbox.

The main USGS toolbox is at [DOI/gems-tools-pro](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/gems-tools-pro).

## Acknowledgements

GeMS Tools was originally written by in Python 2.7 by Ralph Haugerud, Evan Thoms, and others and ported to Python 3 by Evan Thoms. Tools in the GMR section were written by Adam Link and Jennie Latane.
